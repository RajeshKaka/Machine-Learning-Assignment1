Question 1

The datasets are read using read_csv() and Sex and Embark are replaced with numerical values for finding the correlation heatmap shows the correlation and Sex has the highest value of the correlation
We need to keep the "Sex" feature because it has high correlation with survived which is the feature which is to be found
Accuracy_score() is used to find the accuracy

Question 2

Train_test_split() is used to split the training and testing data and random state=0 gives the same testing and training split every time

Naive bayes has more accuracy than the support vector machine from the above because the features given are independent and their is no linear seperation boundary
