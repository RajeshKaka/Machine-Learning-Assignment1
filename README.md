Question 1

The datasets are read using read_csv() and Sex and Embark are replaced with numerical values for finding the correlation heatmap shows the correlation and Sex has the highest value of the correlation
We need to keep the "Sex" feature because it has high correlation with survived which is the feature which is to be found
Accuracy_score() is used to find the accuracy

Question 2

Train_test_split() is used to split the training and testing data and random state=0 gives the same testing and training split every time

Naive bayes has more accuracy than the support vector machine from the above because the features given are independent and their is no linear seperation boundary

Question - 1

Hierarchical Methods: Data is grouped into a tree like structure. There are two main clustering algorithms in this method:
*Divisive Clustering
*Agglomerative Clustering

There are 3 variants in Agglomerative method:
*Agglomerative Algorithm: Single Link - Single-nearest distance or single linkage is the agglomerative method that uses the distance between the closest members of the two clusters.

*Agglomerative Algorithm: Complete Link - In this algorithm, complete farthest distance or complete linkage is the agglomerative method that uses the distance between the members that are the farthest apart

*Agglomeartive Algorithm: Average Link - Average-average distance or average linkage is the method that involves looking at the distances between all pairs and averages all of these distances. This is also called Universal Pair Group Mean Averaging.

Question 2:

* Standard scalar standardizes features of the data set by scaling to unit variance and removing the mean (optionally) using column summary statistics on the samples in the training set.

* Normalization is a technique often applied as part of data preparation for machine learning. The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to use a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information.

*The Principal Component Analysis is a popular unsupervised learning technique for reducing the dimensionality of data. It increases interpretability yet, at the same time, it minimizes information loss.

*Agglomerative Clustering is a bottom-up strategy in which each data point is originally a cluster of its own, and as one travels up the hierarchy, more pairs of clusters are combined.
